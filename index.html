    <h1>Hello mr caleb! I want to appeal to you to not take a whole 30 marks
        from my score this time, because you find it unreadable.<br>
        I'm just starting out, and simply following basic instructions.
        The instruction says i should use comments to seperate my work, 
        and that's what i'm doing.<br>
        The scores mean alot to me and Taking 30 marks out of it is quite discouraging.
        Thank you for your consideration.
